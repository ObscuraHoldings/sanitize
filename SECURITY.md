# Security / Limitations

Sanitize removes metadata and active content from PDFs and DOCX files.

Limitations
- No guarantee of removing proprietary or malformed data in unusual files.
- Not a malware scanner; does not protect against reader exploits.

Best Practices

- Verify outputs and review sidecar JSON reports.
